        <h2>Activities and Intents (AND102)</h2>
<p>Most apps contain multiple pages. The most common way to implement this in Android is using one Activity for each page and stack navigation to transition between pages. This course shows you how to code the core patterns that make Activities work together. You will see how to start Activities, pass arguments, and retrieve results. You will also see how to launch standard Android Activities such as the camera or the web browser.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Explore the completed exercise</a>
<br>
<p>This exercise asks you to run an app that demonstrates the course goals. The image below shows the various screens of the app. The lines indicate the transitions between Activities and the arrowheads show the direction of data flow. Your goal in this exercise is to work with the app so you understand its structure - subsequent exercises will ask you to begin with a starter version of this app and write the code to implement all the Activity transitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Start an Activity in your .apk</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to use Explicit Intents to start Activities from your application package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Programmatically end an Activity</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to end an Activity programmatically. This is useful whenever you need to implement something like a <em>Save</em> or <em>Cancel</em> button in your user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise 4: Pass arguments to an activity</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to pass arguments to an Activity. You will see how to load arguments in the source Activity and how to retrieve them in the target Activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part5.html">Exercise 5: Get activity results</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to return results from an Activity. You will see how to load the results in the target Activity and how to retrieve them in the source Activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part6.html">Exercise 6: Launch a system activity</a>
<br>
<p>The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to launch an Android system Activity (i.e. an Activity installed with Android and not part of your application). </p>
</li>
</ol>
